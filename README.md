<h3>Installation</h3>
The project is largely web-based and requires no installation. However, 

<h3>Usage</h3>
The intention is to have individuals and businesses who are interested in our services to create an account with us on the platform, describe their project and probably attach sketches of what they want. In turn, Melbur Studios will develop their software, app, or management system or do the design work that they require. The platform provides a form where the business or individual enters their personal or business details and describes what they want us to develop for them.

<h3>Contributing</h3>
In this venture, I employed the use of online resources which helped me narrow down and shape this project into what we have now. Of course, it will continue to be improved upon, and some things might be deprecated with time. However, with each improvement, this README will also be updated

<h3>Licensing</h3>
This project is owned by Melbur Ventures Ltd, a registered company in Kenya.
